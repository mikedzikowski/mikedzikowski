### Hi there 👋, I'm Mike. I like to dabble in all things automation, PowerShell, and Azure! 

- 🔭 I’m an Azure FastTrack Engineer at Microsoft where I am part of the FastTrack Azure Infrastructure team.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/father/golfer
- ⚡ Fun fact: The original project for what ultimately became Microsoft Azure was a project code-named "Project Red Dog".
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)
